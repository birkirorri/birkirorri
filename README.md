## Hi there i am Birkir👋

# I'm a newly graduated bioinformatician 😄 

# 👣 My journey: 

☑️ I got my bachelor degree in Molecular biology at University of Iceland

☑️ During my studies i worked at both the University of Iceland and later at the cancer reasearch center at the Landspitali Hospital where i created plasmids and reasearched the BRCA1 gene

☑️ Moved to Denmark to pursue a MSc. degree in Compuatational Biology

☑️ During my studies there i learned a lot about analysing data but also alot about generative models and deep learning

☑️ Got the oppurtunity to do a masters project about deep learning that furthered my insights into that field


# On my Github you fill find some of my projects (some finished, some ongoing) i very much like to tinker in all kinds of data

- I love tinkering with all kinds of data, all the way from biological data to trying to find a way to predict Clear air turbulance (i hate turbulance) 🧬 ✈️
