## Hi there i am Birkir👋

### I'm a newly graduated bioinformatician 😄

👣 My journey:

☑️ I got my bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biology at the University of Iceland

☑️ During my studies I worked at both the University of Iceland and later at the Cancer Research Center at the Landspitali Hospital, where I created plasmids and researched the BRCA1 gene

☑️ Moved to Denmark to pursue an MSc degree in Computational Biology

☑️ During my studies there I learned a lot about analyzing data but also a lot about generative models and deep learning

☑️ Got the opportunity to do a master’s project about deep learning that furthered my insights into that field

- On my GitHub you will find some of my projects (some finished, some ongoing)

- I love tinkering with all kinds of data, all the way from biological data to trying to find a way to predict clear-air turbulence (I hate turbulence) 🧬 ✈️
